### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub. Here you can find stuff that I am working on and also that I had learnt over time. But please keep in mind that I work in many private projetcs that aren't even in this account and I don't always have time to build something personal to show my skills over here (but I try!). So, if you want to know a little better what I can do, don't be afraid to ask me :)

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on several web projetcs using ReactJS, NextJS, CSS3, HTML5 and some AWS Cloud services such as API Gateway, DynamoDB, Lambda and others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning automated tests, Docker, Serveless and going deeper on my React knowledge
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that have good impact and offer space and opportunity to grow as a professional
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding a little better "where am I" in the knowledge standards
- 📫 How to reach me: You can email me on leonardosoareszuin@gmail.com or send me a message on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/lzuin/)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a dog named Java 🐶
